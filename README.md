# Signal Coding Challenge
>  I would like for you to create a Node.JS service that allows me to send to it a CSV file, and it returns a JSON object. This should be consumable as an API.
Additionally, I would like you to setup EsLint to the Airbnb eslint standards, and dockerize it.

*Helpful Tips*
  - [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
  - [CSV Parsing](https://www.papaparse.com/)
  - [Eslint AirBnB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb)

*Bonus Points* If you manage to breeze through that, bonus points can be awarded for any of the following.
  - es6 syntax
  - commented logic (why you did that, what was your thinking)
  - Unit Tests :)
  - A roadmap.md to describe what you might do next
  - Clean commit history, following best practices...
  - Error handling (error boundaries -- or tell me where you might consider putting them)
  - Actually deploy it? (not required, but would be cool)

*How it will be judged* I care more about understanding your logic / plan behind a choice than I care about you having made the perfect choice. Pick something, go with it, be open to criticism -- that's how we learn.
